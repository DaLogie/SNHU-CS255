# SNHU-CS255

The DriverPass project was a system we worked on throught the class of CS255. The client was a driving school that wanted a system to help student drivers schedule driving tests and manage related data, such as user accounts and session records.

One area where I excelled was in developing detailed design requirements, which laid a solid foundation for the system.

If I could revise one part of my work, I would improve my initial UML use case diagrams by including all the required use cases outlined by the client. I’d use a more professional outline and ensure that I included a more clear and consise diagram. I felt mine was a bit cluttered as I would add something after already starting.

To interpret the user's needs, I carefully read and reread the client meeting transcript to fully understand their expectations. This step is crucial because no matter how well a system is designed, it won’t be successful if it doesn’t meet the client’s requirements.

When designing software, I start by documenting all the program requirements and identifying the components needed for the system. In the future, I’d incorporate more advanced project planning strategies and ideas. I would have liked for my diagrams to be a bit more.
