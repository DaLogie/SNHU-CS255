# SNHU-CS255

The DriverPass project was a fictional system we worked on in CS255. The client was a driving school that wanted a system to help student drivers schedule driving tests and manage related data, such as user accounts and session records.

One thing I did particularly well was creating detailed design requirements for the system, ensuring that the foundational aspects were clearly outlined.

If I could revise one part of my work, I would improve my initial UML use case diagrams by including all the required use cases outlined by the client. I’d use a more professional tool like LucidChart to create clearer, more accurate diagrams instead of relying on MS Paint.

To interpret the user's needs, I carefully read and reread the client meeting transcript to fully understand their expectations. This step is crucial because no matter how well a system is designed, it won’t be successful if it doesn’t meet the client’s requirements.

When designing software, I start by documenting all the program requirements and identifying the components needed for the system. In the future, I’d incorporate more advanced project planning tools like LucidChart or similar platforms to better illustrate system designs and improve my overall workflow.
